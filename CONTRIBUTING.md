# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Eik ðŸ§¡

This module is a [shared config for ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs). We accept changes that should apply to all repositories in the [eik-lib origanisation](https://github.com/eik-lib).

Commits should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

A change in configuration is considered a `patch` in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A new export would be a `minor`. Updating the `peerDependency` to a higher version would be a `major`.

This repo uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate releases whenever changes are merged to the default branch.
